Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
===============================

An analog to digital converter is a device that converts continuous analog signals into discrete digital signals.
A 12-bit analog to digital converter has a resolution of 4096, meaning it can take analog input values from 0 to 4095
and convert them to digital values. A 115200 baud rate means that the converter can take up to 115200 samples per second.
The converter converts the analog signal into a digital signal by measuring the amplitude of the signal at regular intervals and encoding it as a
binary number. The analog to digital converter will be used to convert the analog signal from the optical reciever into a digital, which will be 
used to compute the FFT.
